//    You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:

//0 representing an empty cell,
//1 representing a fresh orange, or
//2 representing a rotten orange.
//Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

//Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.
//Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
//Output: 4
// example 2
//    Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
//Output: -1
//Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner(row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.

//        Example 3:

//Input: grid = [[0,2]]
//Output: 0
//Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
